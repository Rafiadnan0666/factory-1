##  Hero Description

**FACTORY 404** is an immersive, retro-futuristic terminal simulation that transports players to the year 2042, where they manage an experimental quantum manufacturing facility. As the operator of this cutting-edge production core, you must balance efficiency with stability while navigating the dangerous allure of quantum corruption.

The experience combines the nostalgic aesthetic of 1980s terminal interfaces with sophisticated modern web technologies, creating a unique blend of old-school computing and futuristic quantum mechanics. Players must make strategic decisions about upgrades, manage random system events, and ultimately decide whether to play it safe or push the boundaries of reality itself.
